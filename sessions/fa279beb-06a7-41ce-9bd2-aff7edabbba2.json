I've completed the subdomain reconnaissance for `example.com` as requested.\n\nAfter running `subfinder`, `assetfinder`, and `amass`, it looks like we didn't identify any publicly resolvable subdomains for `example.com` at this time.\n\nThis can sometimes happen if the target is very small, new, or has strong privacy configurations. Given that `example.com` is often used for documentation and testing, it's quite common for it to have a minimal public footprint.\n\nIf you suspect there might be subdomains, we could try a few things:\n*   **Expand Tooling:** We could incorporate additional passive tools (like those checking certificate transparency logs) or even some brute-force techniques if applicable.\n*   **Check DNS History:** Sometimes older records or public DNS archives can reveal subdomains not currently active.\n*   **Target Clarification:** For domains like `example.com`, it's worth considering its nature \u2013 it's often a placeholder with limited actual infrastructure.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to dive deeper or if you have another target in mind!",
