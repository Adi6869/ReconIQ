ReconIQ here, ready with the subdomain check for `example.com`.\n\nI just finished running **Subfinder** against `example.com`, and it looks like **no subdomains were discovered** this time around.\n\nThis can happen for a few reasons: `example.com` might genuinely not have publicly discoverable subdomains, or sometimes a single tool might just miss things.\n\nFor a more comprehensive search, I'd suggest trying some other subdomain enumeration tools and techniques. We could explore options like:\n\n*   **Amass:** It uses a wider array of sources and active enumeration.\n*   **Assetfinder:** Another great passive subdomain discovery tool.\n*   **Brute-forcing common subdomain names** with a tool like `gobuster` or `ffuf` if you want to get more active.\n*   **Checking Certificate Transparency logs** (e.g., via `crt.sh` or specific tools).\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to kick off a scan with any of those!",
