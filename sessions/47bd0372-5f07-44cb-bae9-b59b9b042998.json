ReconIQ here with the update on `example.com`.\n\nI just ran `dnsx` to enumerate the DNS records for `example.com`, and it looks like **we didn't find any records** in this pass.\n\nThis can sometimes happen for a few reasons:\n*   `dnsx` might not have been configured to look for all possible record types (e.g., only A records by default).\n*   The target domain might not have publicly accessible records of the types `dnsx` was querying.\n*   Or, it could simply be that there truly aren't any records that `dnsx` could resolve under its current settings.\n\n**For your next steps, I'd suggest:**\n1.  **Specify Record Types:** Try running `dnsx` again, but explicitly ask for common record types like `A`, `AAAA`, `MX`, `NS`, `TXT`, and `SRV` to cast a wider net.\n2.  **Try Other Tools:** Consider using `dig` or `nslookup` for a more granular, direct query, or even `subfinder` for broader domain enumeration that often includes DNS information.\n3.  **Check for Subdomains:** Sometimes a lack of direct records means the interesting stuff is on subdomains.\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed, and I'll queue up the next task!",
