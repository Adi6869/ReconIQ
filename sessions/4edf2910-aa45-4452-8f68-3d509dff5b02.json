I've just finished running `eyewitness` to try and capture some web screenshots for `target.com`, as you asked.\n\nIt looks like `eyewitness` didn't find any web services to screenshot, so there are no images to report this time.\n\nThis can happen for a few reasons:\n*   `target.com` might not be reachable from my current vantage point.\n*   There might not be a web server running on standard HTTP/S ports (80/443).\n*   A firewall could be blocking access to web services.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nTo dig a bit deeper, I'd suggest we first confirm if `target.com` is actually up and responsive. We could:\n1.  **Ping the target:** See if the host is online.\n2.  **Perform a port scan (e.g., with Nmap):** This would help us identify if any web services are running on standard or non-standard ports.\n3.  **Check for specific subdomains or different protocols:** Sometimes the main domain doesn't host a web service, but a subdomain does.\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed, happy to help explore further!",
