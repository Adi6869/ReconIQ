ReconIQ here, ready with the reconnaissance update for `scanme.nmap.org`.\n\nI've just finished running both Nmap and Naabu to scan for open HTTP ports on `scanme.nmap.org`, and it looks like **neither tool reported any open HTTP ports.**\n\nThis can happen for a few reasons:\n*   The target might not be running an HTTP service on the standard ports (like 80 or 443).\n*   The target could be blocking the specific scan parameters used, or a firewall might be dropping packets.\n*   The service might be running on non-standard ports.\n\n**Next steps I'd recommend:**\n\n1.  **Widen the Net:** Instead of just standard HTTP ports, try scanning a broader range of ports, perhaps the top 1000 or even all 65535 ports, using Nmap's `-p-` flag.\n2.  **Service Version Detection:** Use Nmap with `-sV` to attempt to identify services running on any open ports, regardless of what port they're on.\n3.  **Basic Host Reachability:** Ping the host (`ping scanme.nmap.org`) to ensure it's generally responsive.\n4.  **Confirm Target:** Double-check that `scanme.nmap.org` is indeed the intended target and not a typo.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to try a different scan configuration or explore other reconnaissance avenues!",
