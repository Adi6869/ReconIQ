      "content": "Hey there! ReconIQ here.\n\nI've just wrapped up the subdomain reconnaissance for `example.com` using `subfinder` and `amass`.\n\n**Here's the rundown:**\nIt looks like we didn't uncover any subdomains for `example.com` with the tools used in this run. Sometimes this happens, especially for domains that aren't heavily branched or have very tight DNS configurations.\n\n**Next Steps & Recommendations:**\nIf you're still keen on finding subdomains (and often there are some lurking!), we could try a few other strategies:\n1.  **Passive OSINT Expansion:** We could explore other passive sources or tools that might query different datasets.\n2.  **DNS Brute-forcing:** A more active approach would be to try brute-forcing common subdomain names, though this is more resource-intensive.\n3.  **Certificate Transparency Logs:** Checking CT logs can sometimes reveal subdomains if they have SSL certificates.\n\nJust let me know if you'd like to proceed with any of these alternative approaches, or if there's anything else I can help you with!",
