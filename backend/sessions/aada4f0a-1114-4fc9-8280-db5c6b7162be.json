ReconIQ here, reporting on your subdomain reconnaissance for `example.com`.\n\nI've completed the scan using both `subfinder` and `amass`, and it looks like **no subdomains were identified** for `example.com` in this run.\n\nThis can happen for a few reasons: `example.com` is often used as a placeholder domain, or it might genuinely not have any publicly discoverable subdomains that these passive enumeration tools could find.\n\n**Here are a few suggestions for next steps:**\n\n1.  **Verify the Target:** Just to be sure, please confirm `example.com` is the precise domain you intended to investigate.\n2.  **Expand the Search Methods:** If you suspect there might be subdomains, we could try more active enumeration techniques, like using wordlists for brute-forcing (e.g., with `gobuster` or `dnsgen`), or checking Certificate Transparency logs for historical records.\n3.  **Try a Different Domain:** If you have another target in mind, I'm ready to run a fresh scan for you!\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed, and I'll be happy to assist further!",
